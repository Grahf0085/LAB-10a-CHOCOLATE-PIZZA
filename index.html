        <p>For the fig-swirl: Melt butter over medium in a saucepan. Add brown sugar and stir to dissolve. Halve all of
            the figs and toss in the saucepan with water and lemon juice. Cook over medium heat, stirring frequently
            until you have a chunky-jammy micture. Add salt with one or two stirs, set aside and let look completely.
        </p>

        <p>Ice cream: In a small pot over medium heat, combine milk, and granulated sugar until sugar is completely
            dissolved and the milk is just barely lukewarm. Whisk in the egg yolks. Set mixture in the fridge and wait
            until the fig mixture is cooled.</p>

        <p>Using an ice cream machine, pour liquids into the frozen basin and process according to manufacturer
            instructions, ie., let spin and thicken for 20 minutes before adding mascarpone, fig jam mixture, and the
            nuts. Continue to process for +/-10 minutes. Pour ssemi-frozen micture into the pyrex dish or glass
            tuperware. Freeze for at least two hours before serving.</p>
